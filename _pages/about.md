I am a postdoctoral researcher in Multimedia Computing working with the [Centre for Digital Health](http://socialmedialab.upenn.edu/) and the [World Well-Being Project](http://www.wwbp.org/) at the University of Pennsylvania. My research aims to leverage large-scale social media image and text data to model social health outcomes and psychological traits. 
 
Prior to this, I completed my PhD studies on modeling users personality in multimedia preferences at the School of Computer Science and Engineering in the [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](http://ntu.edu.sg). I also worked on building Deep Learning Frameworks for Facial Action Unit Recognition while interning at Panasonic R&D. I received my undergraduate degree from [BITS-Pilani, India](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad) in Computer Science.
