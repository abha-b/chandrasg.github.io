Other Projects
======
* **Rating Passes in Soccer Using Real-Time Spatio-Temporal Data Streams**: Over the last few years with the advent of Big Data, professional soccer teams want to build automated systems to improve decision making and reduce manual effort in post-match analysis. This work is expected to contribute towards building an automated soccer analytical system which will utilize computational geometry and data mining techniques to analyze spatio-temporal data streams to classify passes in soccer as Good, Ok or Bad ones.
In this work, we describe a prototype system that preprocess spatio-temporal data and generate features which are used as input to classification functions. Features are generated based on the quantitative attributes described from the field of computational geometry with respect to soccer analysis. Features generated from the system are used as input to classification algorithms. The created system is expected to aid players, coaches and soccer team management to analyze performance and access the quality of passes. Quality of passes has to be quantitatively evaluated to understand players’ performance and the team’s performance. Finally, this work discusses the implementation results of classification and concludes with future enhancements.

* **Facial Keypoint Detection**: We propose two different methodologies to detect key points on facial images. One based completely on a thorough analysis of dataset and using basic concepts of Data Mining to come up with a solution for the Kaggle Facial Key Point Detection challenge. This resulted in a root mean square error of 3.8 and a position of 34 out of 149 submissions on Kaggle Leaderboard. Second is a local descriptor based approach (LDA), where we present a feature descriptor and analyse its performance. We present a thorough literature survey of the state-of-the-art in this area and analyse the results given by their methods based on which we propose our own feature descriptor calling it Global Descriptor Approach (GDA).
